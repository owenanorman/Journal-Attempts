    I woke up at 4:45 and stayed in my bed until around 5:00 just listening to music, I started to try and finish the portfolio assignment but was unable to do so and just super confused so i went 
    on slack and asked my teacher if she could help me with it, I then finished the quizzes and the trivia game assignment, and then started to do some code academy. I then went to fitness connection and worked out legs and went in the sauna a little bit, I actually went in before and after working out 
    then came home. and cleaned a little bit then did some school work and stretched, I then made a protein shake and went to work and did a 2-7 and never actually had a break so I didnt drink it at all, but I then got a case of bunditinies and went home and 
    played a game of league and just went to bed, my dad also got me nuggets and fries from wendys and that was my day
